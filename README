saugns is the Scriptable AUdio GeNeration System,
the implementation of the SAU (Scriptable AUdio) language.

SAU is a simple language for mathematical sound synthesis,
without support for the use of pre-recorded samples.
While the language is still primitive relative to the
goal (a useful language for writing electronic music),
it makes it simple to experiment with sounds.

A collection of basic wave types are supported, as well as
AM, FM, and PM (the "FM" of most commercial synthesizers).
An arbitrary number of oscillators can be used.

See 'doc/README.SAU' for a concise SAU language reference.
Example scripts under 'examples/' use the main features of
the language.

The program reads SAU (Scriptable AUdio) files or strings,
and can output to system audio and/or a 16-bit PCM WAV file.
Basic usage information is provided with the -h option. More
can be found in the man page and on the website,
<https://saugns.github.io/>.

Tested mainly on x86 and x86-64. Comes with support for
running on DragonFly, FreeBSD, Linux, NetBSD, and OpenBSD.
The following audio systems are expected:
	DragonFly	OSS
	FreeBSD  	OSS
	Linux    	ALSA or OSS
	NetBSD   	OSS
	OpenBSD  	sndio

Building and installing
=======================

Building requires a C99 compiler toolchain and
running `make` (GNU or BSD). (There is no "configure" step.)

On Linux systems, the ALSA library (libasound2) must first be installed.
In the cases of the 4 major BSDs, the base systems have it all.

A simple test after building is the following, which should
play a sine wave at 444Hz for 1 second:
	./saugns -e "Osin"

`make install` will by default copy 'saugns' to '/usr/local/bin/',
and the contents of 'doc/' and 'examples/' to
directories under '/usr/local/share/':
	'doc/saugns/README.SAU' 	SAU language reference.
	'examples/saugns/' 		Example and test scripts.
(`make uninstall` removes the saugns binary and share directories.)

After installation, the saugns(1) man page gives
basic usage information and points to these files.
