ssndgen is a Scriptable SouND GENerator. A very lightweight
system for mathematical sound synthesis, it
doesn't support using pre-recorded samples.

While developed with the aim of becoming useful for writing
electronic music, the language is still very simple and the audio
retro-ish. It is however easy to use for experimenting with sounds.

A collection of basic wave types are supported, as well
as AM, FM, and PM (the "FM" of most commercial synthesizers).
An arbitrary number of oscillators can be used.

The program reads Sound Generation Script files or strings.
Output can be to system audio, and/or a 16-bit PCM WAV file.

Supported platforms include x86 and x86-64,
running DragonFly, FreeBSD, Linux, NetBSD, or OpenBSD.
Other systems are untested. The following audio systems are expected:
	DragonFly	OSS
	FreeBSD  	OSS
	Linux    	ALSA or OSS
	NetBSD   	OSS
	OpenBSD  	sndio

Building and installing
=======================

Building requires a C99 compiler and `make` (GNU or BSD).
On Linux systems, the ALSA library must be installed to build.
In the cases of the 4 major BSDs, the base systems have it all.

A simple test after building is the following, which should
play a sine wave at 444Hz for 1 second:
	./ssndgen -e "Osin"

`make install` will by default copy 'ssndgen' to '/usr/local/bin/',
and the contents of 'examples/' to '/usr/local/share/ssndgen/'.
(`make uninstall` removes the ssndgen binary and directory.)

Script syntax overview
======================

General description
-------------------

The current syntax uses keywords followed by zero or more
parameters with arguments. Each main keyword provides an action,
either at run time (like a function call in other languages),
or at parse time (like a global script setting).

The most important keyword, "O" followed by a wavetype, adds an
operator. Operators are oscillators with parameters, and may be
connected as carriers and modulators. They, and the timing of their
running, make the core features of the scripting language.

Events and timing are central; each addition of an operator, or
later change to operator or voice parameters, is an event. Timing
modifiers may be used quite freely in the script to change the
relative time placement of events.

Keyword parameters may either be set (named, followed by writing
their argument(s)), or left out to use the previous value or a
default value. Some default values can be changed using the "S"
(set option) parse-time action.

Modifiers are similar to keywords, but simpler and more flexible
in how they may be used. They may or may not be followed by an
argument (e.g. a delay time).

Keywords
--------

Each of these keywords is further described in its own section below.
	S	Set option (parameter default value or other);
		runs during parsing.
	O	Add operator; an oscillator with parameters, either a
		carrier which produces sound for a duration, or a
		modulator; the "O" must be immediately followed by the
		(initial) wave type, as in "Osin".
	P	Panning for the voice at the current location; to be
		followed by the new value.
	Q	Quit script; end parsing, turning all that follows
		into a comment. (Optional.) Other ways to comment exist.

See the section 'Timing' for modifiers.

Set option: S
-------------

Set parameter default value or other option; runs during parsing.
Usage: "S", followed by zero or more parameters, each with a value.

Parameters:
	f	Set default O "f" (frequency, Hz) value; defaults to 444.
	r	Set default O "r" (relative frequency) value; defaults to 1.
	t	Set default O "t" (time, seconds) value; defaults to 1.
	a	Set multiplier for O "a" (amplitude) value, applied when
		adding a top-level carrier. If used, this disables automatic
		down-scaling of amplitude by the number of voices, for
		manual control instead.
	n	Sets A4 tuning (Hz) for O "f" (frequency, Hz) value using
		note syntax; defaults to 444.

Operator: O (followed by wave type)
-----------------------------------

Add operator. If a carrier and not a modulator, adds sound at current time
position, playing for the time duration.

Usage: "O" followed by (initial) wave type (e.g. "Osin"), followed by zero
or more parameters, each with a value.

Wave types:
	sin	Sine.
			For cosine, use (1/4) phase.
	sqr	Square (anti-aliased cycle).
			Lacks full "bite" at low frequencies.
	tri	Triangle (naive).
	saw	Saw (anti-aliased cycle).
			Lacks full "bite" at low frequencies.
			Decreasing slope; use negative amplitude
			or frequency for increasing slope.
	sha	Half-frequency absolute sine (adjusted).
			Frequency halved to restore base frequency,
			peak amplitude centered and doubled, phase
			shifted to begin and end at zero amplitude.
			A softer alternative to "saw" (saw wave).
	szh	Half-zero'd sine (adjusted).
			Positive half kept, negative half zero'd,
			peak amplitude centered and doubled, phase
			shifted to begin and end at zero amplitude.
			A warm and full sound.
	ssr	Square root of sine.
			Mirrored for the negative half.
			A softer alternative to "sqr" (square wave).

Parameters:
	t	Time duration in seconds. If no t setting is given, the
		time set depends on the context.
			For a single non-nested operator, 1 is used unless
		the default value is changed with "S t".
			When several operators are specified at the same
		time and time is explicitly set for at least one, the
		default time is the combined duration of their play.
		(t* can also be used to specify this explicitly.)
			For nested operators, i.e. modulators, the default
		time is infinite (can also be set as "ti"), meaning they
		play whenever a carrier they are linked to does. Infinite
		duration is only supported for nested operators, all scripts
		having finite duration.
			For a composite event, the first part is given the
		S default value if none set. The following parts will each
		in turn be given the value of the preceding part if not
		explicitly set - with the exception of nested operators for
		the last part, which will have infinite time (ti) by default.
	f	Frequency in Hz. Can be negative to flip wave shape timewise.
			"Value ramp" values are supported; see section.
			"Modulation with value range" is supported for FM
		(frequency modulation); see section.
	r	(For modulator operators only.) Relative frequency, a value
		which will be multiplied by the carrier frequency to give
		the frequency to use. For an n:m carrier-modulator frequency
		ratio, a value of the form (m/n) may be used; e.g., for a
		3:4 frequency ratio, "r(4/3)".
			"Value ramp" values are supported; see section.
			"Modulation with value range" is supported for FM
		(frequency modulation); see section.
	a	Amplitude, where 1.0 corresponds to a level of 0dB and
		0.0 is silence. (Note that the final output level is scaled
		down by the number of voices; alternatively, the S "a" option
		can be used to set a multiplier used when adding a top-level
		carrier. Panning will further reduce output level unless
		fully left or right.) Can be negative to flip sign of result.
			"Value ramp" values are supported; see section.
			"Modulation with value range" is supported for AM
		(amplitude modulation); see section.
	p	Set the phase of the wave, and/or PM (phase modulation)
		modulators to use.
			A value modulo 1.0 is used to set phase as a
		percentage of the wave cycle. For example, p(3/4) will move
		a sine or triangle wave to its "bottom". This is mostly
		useful for changing the initial phase.
			After a value or by itself, "+[]" (plus and square
		brackets) can be used to set a list of modulator operators
		specified within the "[]"; the list replaces any previous
		modulators set, and may be empty.
			The sum of modulator amplitudes is used to
		phase-modulate the carrier(s).
	s	Silent time before playing, time in seconds.
			Works like adding a delay, except it only affects this
		operator.
	w	Set the wave type. See list of wave types for values.

Panning: P
----------

Set the panning (left-right "balance") of the voice associated with
the present operator(s), affecting the left and right output levels.
Value range is 0 (all-left) to 1 (all-right). Default is 0.5 (center).
Panning not at either extreme end will reduce level.
		"Value ramp" values are supported; see section.

Quit: Q
-------

Quit script; end parsing, turning all that follows into a comment.
(Optional.)

Generally, comments are added using "#" (line comment) instead.

Values and expressions
----------------------

Whitespace is not allowed within multi-character names, keywords or
numbers, and separates values. Spaces and tabs may otherwise be used or
omitted anywhere.

Following a "#", the rest of a line is commented out.

Numerical expressions are allowed within parentheses, allowing numbers
to be specified using basic arithmetic and freely placed whitespace.

Value ramp:
	To ramp or "sweep" a parameter which supports this towards a
	target value, the following sub-parameters can be given values
	within "{}" (curly brackets):
	v	Target value.
	t	Time to reach target value (default re-use time duration).
	c	Ramp curve type (default 'lin'):
			hold	Hold old value until time.
			lin	Linear trajectory over time.
			exp	Exponential trajectory over time.
			log	A "log(1 + x)" trajectory over time.
			esd	Exponentially saturate or decay.
			lsd	Logarithmically saturate or decay.
		(The 'exp' and 'log' types use ear-tuned polynomial
		approximations with definite beginnings and ends,
		designed to sound natural, and symmetric one to another.
		The 'esd' increases like 'log' and decreases like 'exp',
		like a capacitor, natural-sounding for envelope-like use.
		The 'lsd' increases like 'exp' and decreases like 'log'.)

Modulation with value range:
	Amplitude and frequency (absolute or relative) parameters support
	AM or FM, respectively, with a value range.
		Following the letter specifying the parameter, and optionally
	the normal value, a second value can be specified after a "," (comma)
	for a bounded range of values from the modulation.
		After value(s) or by itself, "~[]" (tilde and square brackets)
	can be used to set a list of modulator operators specified within the
	"[]"; the list replaces any previous modulators set, and may be empty.
		Each such modulator will produce a result in a 0.0 to 1.0
	range, i.e. a positive signal, multiplied by its amplitude parameter
	(defaulting to 1.0).
		The product of modulator amplitudes is mapped to the value
	range; 0.0 means the normal value and 1.0 means the second value.
	Setting (changing) the amplitude for modulators may thus change
	the range, but is allowed for the sake of flexibility.

Parameters and operator binding:
	When specifying or referencing operators within "@[...]", any
	parameters set following the closing ']' will be bound to and apply
	to all of them.
		Significantly, this allows multiple carriers (given within
	the []) to be linked to the same modulator(s), whether for FM, PM,
	or AM. (Note: Support for this is experimental and incomplete.)

Labels and referencing:
	Any operator when specified may be prefixed by "'label " in order
	to define a label for it, where the label consists of alphanumeric
	characters and/or '_'; thereafter the label can be referenced using
	"@label", to place future changes later in the script.
		Note that a "@label" reference placed in a nesting scope
	different from the original does not add the operator to the new
	nesting scope. (It will not be moved out from nor into a list by
	being referenced anywhere.) The time scope is however new and of
	the reference.

Frequencies as notes:
	Frequency values may be specified as notes. Currently, justly
	intoned C-major scale is supported; "S n" sets the A4 tuning
	(default 444Hz).
		The value consists of the note (C, D, E, F, G, A or B),
	optionally given a prefix and/or suffix. The prefix is an optional
	subnote (c, d, e, f, g, a or b) inside an inner octave (between
	note and next note). The suffix is an optional s (sharp) or
	f (flat), and/or, in the last position, an octave number
	(from 0-10, default 4).

Timing
------

A new event terminates the previous one, but they will have the same
placement in time unless a delay is added.

At the topmost script scope, newlines also terminate events; within
sub-scopes, however, newlines may be placed freely.

Timing modifiers:
	|	Time separator. Delays what follows by the duration of
		prior events. This is independent of delay added
		with "\".
	\	Delay the next event and all following ones, time in
		seconds. Alternatively, \t will delay by the time of the
		last event.

Composite events:
	Writing a ';' (on a new line or the same line) after an event will
	allow specifying new parameter arguments to apply at the end of the
	previous duration; this can be repeated.
		This makes it possible to write a sequence of events as if
	a single "composite event", not having to insert delays that affect
	the timing of events later written, thus increasing the flexibility
	of how changes to operators may be positioned in a script.
