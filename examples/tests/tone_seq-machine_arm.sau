 * Variation #5 of the first saugns script made,
 * originally called "crashtofix.sgs". The script
 * remained after debugging was done, producing its
 * "machine arm" version of the original tone sequence.
 * Further edited to allow more easily varying the sound.
 *
 * Tests nested PM and gradual value changes with
 * compound step syntax.
