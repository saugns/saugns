# Variation #5 of the first sgensys script made,
# originally called "crashtofix.sgs". The script
# remained after debugging was done, producing its
# "machine arm" version of the original tone sequence.
# Further edited to allow more easily varying the sound.
#
# Tests nested PM and gradual value changes with
# compound step syntax.
