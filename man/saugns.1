.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an audio generation program.
Written in C, it implements the SAU (Scriptable AUdio) language \-
a simple language for mathematical sound synthesis.
.Pp
The program reads SAU (Scriptable AUdio) files by default,
or passed strings if the
.Fl e
option is used.
Output is by default to system audio, but may instead be muted and/or
written to a 16-bit PCM WAV file.
.Pp
Scripts can use an arbitrary number of oscillators,
each with one of various wave forms.
Synthesis techniques supported include PM, FM, and AM.
Duration and some other attributes can be calculated for each script
without generating audio; the scripting language is not Turing complete.
.Sh OPTIONS
By default, audio device output is enabled.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Audible; always enable audio device output.
.It Fl m
Muted; always disable audio device output.
.It Fl r
Sample rate in Hz (default 96000);
if unsupported for audio device, warns and prints rate used instead.
.It Fl o
Write a 16-bit PCM WAV file, always using the sample rate requested;
disables audio device output by default.
.It Fl e
Evaluate strings instead of files.
.It Fl c
Check scripts only, reporting any errors or requested info.
.It Fl p
Print info for scripts after loading.
.It Fl h
Print help for topic, or usage information and a list of topics if none.
.It Fl v
Print version.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width OSS_AUDIODEV
.It Ev AUDIODEV
Can be set to change the audio device for
.Nm
to open when using the system audio API it was built to use. (If set to an
empty string or to
.Dq default ,
then the built-in default name will be used
unchanged.) Example values are
.Dq /dev/dsp
for most OSS variants or
.Dq default
for ALSA.
.It Ev OSS_AUDIODEV
For compatibility, is checked as a fallback option for OSS only, when
.Ev AUDIODEV
is unset, empty, or set to
.Dq default .
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
exits with 0 if no scripts are to be processed,
or upon successful processing of one or more scripts,
even if some scripts were excluded due to failed parse or checks.
.Pp
If scripts were to be processed but none of them passed checks for further use,
or if any errors occured after checks (during interpretation and audio output),
1 is returned.
.Sh SAU LANGUAGE SYNTAX
A compact SAU language reference (plaintext) comes with the installation.
By default, it is copied to:
.Pa /usr/local/share/doc/saugns/README.SAU
.Pp
A less compact overview with some examples can be found at:
.Pa https://saugns.github.io/syntax.html
.Sh EXAMPLES
One-second beep:
.Dl % "saugns -e ""Osin"""
.Pp
10 seconds of "engine rumble" using PM:
.Dl % "saugns -e ""Osin f137 t10 p+[Osin f32 p+[Osin f42]]"""
.Pp
A set of example scripts come with the installation.
By default, they are copied to:
.Pa /usr/local/share/examples/saugns/
.Sh HISTORY
The program was first written in 2011, released in 2012.
Reworked after 2017, renamed from sgensys to saugns in 2019.
