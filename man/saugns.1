.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an audio generation program.
Written in C, it implements the SAU (Scriptable AUdio) language \-
a simple language for mathematical audio synthesis.
.Pp
The program reads SAU (Scriptable AUdio) files by default,
or passed strings if the
.Fl e
option is used.
Output is by default to system audio, but may instead be muted and/or
written to a 16-bit PCM WAV file; it is also possible to stream audio
data to stdout.
.Pp
Scripts can use an arbitrary number of oscillators,
each with one of various wave forms.
Synthesis techniques supported include PM, FM, and AM.
Duration and some other attributes can be calculated for each script
without generating audio; the scripting language is not Turing complete.
.Sh OPTIONS
By default, system audio output is enabled.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Audible; always enable system audio output.
.It Fl m
Muted; always disable system audio output.
.It Fl r
Sample rate in Hz (default 96000);
if unsupported for system audio, warns and prints rate used instead.
.It Fl o
Write a 16-bit PCM WAV file, always using the sample rate requested;
disables system audio output by default.
.It Fl \-mono
Downmix and output audio as mono; this applies to all outputs.
.It Fl \-stdout
Send 16-bit audio output to stdout, always using the sample rate requested.
Reserves stdout for audio; all text printing will be to stderr.
This does not disable any other audio output.
.It Fl c
Check scripts only, reporting any errors or requested info.
.It Fl p
Print info for scripts after loading.
It will be printed to stdout unlike errors and warnings, unless
.Fl \-stdout
reserves it for audio, in which case all printing is to stderr.
.It Fl e
Evaluate strings instead of files.
.It Fl h
Print help for topic, or usage information and a list of topics if none.
.It Fl v
Print version.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width OSS_AUDIODEV
.It Ev AUDIODEV
Can be set to change the system audio device for
.Nm
to open when using the system audio API it was built to use. (If set to an
empty string or to
.Dq default ,
then the built-in default name will be used
unchanged.) Example values are
.Dq /dev/dsp
for most OSS variants or
.Dq default
for ALSA.
.It Ev AUDIODEVICE
For compatibility: For sndio, is checked and handled by its API when
.Ev AUDIODEV is unset, empty, or set to
.Dq default .
.It Ev OSS_AUDIODEV
For compatibility: For OSS, is checked as a fallback option when
.Ev AUDIODEV
is unset, empty, or set to
.Dq default .
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
exits with 0 if no scripts are to be processed,
or upon successful processing of one or more scripts,
even if some scripts were excluded due to failed parse or checks.
.Pp
If scripts were to be processed but none of them passed checks for further use,
or if any errors occured after checks (during interpretation and audio output),
1 is returned.
.Sh SAU LANGUAGE
A compact SAU language reference (plaintext) comes with the installation.
By default, it is copied to:
.Pa /usr/local/share/doc/saugns/README.SAU
.Pp
A less compact and more how-to overview can be found at:
.Pa https://sau.frama.io/language.html
.Sh EXAMPLES
One-second beep:
.Dl % "saugns -e ""Osin"""
.Pp
10 seconds of "engine rumble" using PM:
.Dl % "saugns -e ""Osin f137 t10 p[Osin f32 p[Osin f42]]"""
.Pp
A set of example scripts come with the installation.
By default, they are copied to:
.Pa /usr/local/share/examples/saugns/
.Sh HISTORY
The program was first written in 2011, released in 2012.
Reworked after 2017, renamed from sgensys to saugns in 2019.
